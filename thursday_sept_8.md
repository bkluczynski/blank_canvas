##Problems yesterday
* Rails routes - we are displaying the colour palette on the create view rather than the show page.
* Miro image path.
* (transparencies!)
* Trying to add an SVG thing to the Canva model - not needed!

##Successes yesterday
* Creating a partial to display the SVG instead of doing @canva.svg in the view
* Ben fixing the Miro path!
* Ben made new awesome SVG


##Plan for today
* Update waffle with a file type edge case: no transparencies!
*
